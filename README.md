I'm a fullstack developer, but the backend is where I feel most at home. I like designing how components fit together, having full control over how data flows, and bringing a clean structure to what could easily become a complex mess. Nothing beats seeing everything I’ve put together run smoothly.

When I'm not at the keyboard, you'll most likely find me somewhere in a forest or on a trail with a backback, tent and trangia.

<br>

**What keeps me busy...**
- Designing and building systems with a focus on reliability and clean structure.
- Building small tools and applications that make my own day-to-day a little smoother.
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines that automate the boring parts of shipping software.
- Designing APIs that are clean, consistent and easy to work with.
- Expanding and improving my homelab infrastructure.
- Trying out new technologies and frameworks, and seeing how they fit into my workflow.
